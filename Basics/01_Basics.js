const account_Id=123 // when i want the value not to be changed by any user
let account_Name="tyagi.shailja@gmail.com" //use let since it helps in variable scoping
var account_password="125" //var is not used now a days due to block scope and functional scope issues
account_city="jaipur" //not recommended


console.table([account_Id,account_Name,account_password,account_city]); //can use or cannot use semicolon
